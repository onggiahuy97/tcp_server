Description:
    This server implements a basic TCP sliding-window protocol.
    - Listens on port 12345 and waits for a connection.
    - Performs a handshake: expects "network" from the client and responds with "success".
    - Receives packets formatted as "sequence,window,retransmission_count\n".
    - Uses cumulative ACKs: sends the next expected sequence number as ACK.
    - Tracks:
         * Total packets received (including retransmissions)
         * Unique packets received (in-order arrivals)
         * Missing (dropped) packets (detected via gaps in sequence numbers)
         * Retransmission statistics (counts for 1-4 retransmissions)
         * Goodput over time (logged every 1000 unique packets)
    - After the client disconnects, the server generates four graphs and a CSV file with retransmission stats.
