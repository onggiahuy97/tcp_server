CS 258 Project â€“ Client Side (Dynamic Sliding Window)
Date: [Submission Date]

Description:
    This client implements a dynamic sliding window protocol that mimics TCP congestion control.
    - The window starts at 1 and doubles (up to a maximum of 32) if no drops occur.
    - If a packet drop (simulated with a 1% probability) is detected, the window is reduced.
    - Packets are formatted as "sequence,window,retransmission_count\n", and sequence numbers
      wrap around modulo 65536.
    - Dropped packets are retransmitted every 100 new packets (up to 4 attempts per packet).
    - ACKs from the server (cumulative, indicating the next expected sequence number) are used to
      remove acknowledged packets.
    - Only essential progress information is printed.
